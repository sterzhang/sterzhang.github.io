# About Me

Hi! I’m **Jianshu Zhang (张鉴殊)**. I am a first-year CS Ph.D. student at **Northwestern University**, fortunately co-advised by Prof. [**Manling Li**](https://limanling.github.io/) and Prof. [**Han Liu**](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/liu-han.html).

My research focuses on Multimodal Learning, Agentic AI, and Spatial Understanding.

I’m always keen to discuss new ideas and collaborations—feel free to reach out!
