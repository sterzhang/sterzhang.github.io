# 😊 About Me

Greetings!👋
I'm Jianshu Zhang (张鉴殊), a junior undergraduate student at the [School of Cyber Science and Engineering](http://cse.whu.edu.cn/index.htm), [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/).  Prior to WHU, I spent three years studying at [Shenzhen Middle School](https://www.shenzhong.net/). 

# 🔬 Research Interest
My research interests mainly focus on "AI For Good Use", broadly lie in :
* Large Language Models (Vulnerability Discovering)
* Federated Learning (Privacy Concern)
* Continual Learning (Combine with Federated Learning)
