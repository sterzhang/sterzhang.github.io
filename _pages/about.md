# 😊 About Me

Greetings!👋
I'm Jianshu Zhang (张鉴殊), a junior undergraduate student at the [School of Cyber Science and Engineering](http://cse.whu.edu.cn/index.htm), [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/).  Prior to WHU, I spent three years studying at [Shenzhen Middle School](https://www.shenzhong.net/). I’m open to any possible discussions or collaborate opportunities. If you’re interested in working with me, don’t hesitate to drop me an email!
